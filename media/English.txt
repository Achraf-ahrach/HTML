I'll show you how to convert any video

file to an mp4 if you found this guide

useful then please consider subscribing

once you've done that then please

consider leaving a like and let's get

right into this guy here's a video file

I have on my desktop here and as you can

see this is an MKV file I want to go

make it an mp4 file however this guide

is going to apply for all different

types of video formats so let's get

right into this the first thing you need

to do is go and open up a web browser

like Google Chrome first thing you need

to do is go and open up a web browser so

I'm just going to use Google Chrome but

you can use any and then go to a search

engine like Google and you need to go

and search for a tool called VLC media

player so go and type that in and this

is a free tool both for Windows and Mac

so make sure you go to the official

website which is invideoland.org just

like so and then go and tap on the

download button and the download should

then begin now what you'll then need to

do is wait for this to finish

downloading it's just starting now once

it's finished downloading you can then

go and close your browser and what

you'll need to do is going to find the

installer file which should be in your

downloads folder and what you'll need to

do is double click on it and just run

through the installation instructions

it's just like installing any other app

and then what you'll need to do is go

and open up VLC so what I did is just

search for it and to open it up and once

you've opened it up we can now go and

use this go convert the file to an mp4

so go and click on media in VLC and then

go and tap on convert save and what we

first need to do is go and select the

file we want to go and convert so I'm

going to click on ADD and the file I

want to convert is on my desktop and

it's this one here so click on it once

and click open then once you've done

that go click and convert and Save in

the bottom right and then what you need

to do is make sure convert is selected

come down to profile and the profile I

use is top one here h 2.64 plus MP3 and

that is an mp4 file so tap there but

what I like to do is quickly go make a

configuration so go to the right and

click on this um sort of spanner which

is edit selected profile and then go and

press on audio codec and I like to go

and keep the original audio track and

then go tap save and then just before we

go and Press Start we need to choose

where you want this new file to be saved

to so go click on browse and then you

need to go and choose we want it to be

saved so I'm going to go and put this

onto my desktop so I'm going to name it

finished and just make sure after you've

entered the file name you put dot MP4

just like this then in the bottom right

click save and then you can go and press

start like this and you can then go and

see the progress as it moves across now

for me that didn't take long at all

because the video is only five seconds

however if you've got a longer video

that will take a bit longer but yeah

here is our new file as you can see I'll

put next to each other when I go and

hover over it as you can see it's now an

mp4 and this one is an MKV but they're

exactly the same they're both five

seconds so if you guys found this useful

please consider leaving a like peace
